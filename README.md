# SpotifyUI-Clone
A front-end clone of Spotify's user interface, built using HTML5 and Tailwind CSS. This project replicates the sleek design, layout, and feel of the official Spotify desktop web app, including navigation, playlists, and player controls â€” all styled purely with Tailwind utility classes.
